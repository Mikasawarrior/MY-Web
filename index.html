    <!-- CSS Display property -->
    <!-- It has four different types : Block, Inline, Inline block, none -->
    <!-- Block Property: Block elements are those which take whole width in the web page. Can't add another element horizontally next to the block elemtns -->
    <!-- Block elements: p,h1,div,list,form -->
     <!-- any css applied to the block elements will apply for whole width, If to style separately inside block elemtents have to use spawn see above emaple pro underline grammer -->
    <!-- Span can't chagne width, drawback. -->
    <!-- can change display propert from block to inline or inline to block or change inline block by using display property -->
     <!--Inline CSS  -->
     <!-- Only take width as much it needs and wont block elemets to come next. quite opposite to block -->
     <!-- Common inline  elemtns: span, img, anchor -->
<!-- Inline block -->
<!-- Allows to element on side by and also change width -->
<!-- img is kindof inlineblock element since can change width and position side by side -->
<!-- can change to inline block by change display -->
<!-- may cause space between elemnts while using -->
<!-- None type -->
<!-- if we set display value as none. it moreover removes from website. like delting the code  -->
<!-- Using visiblity hidden can used to be hidden but the position still remains -->

<!-- Positioning -->
<!-- html already have default positioning called static -->
<!-- positioning depeneds on content of element(font size, no of letters),how we order element, childer sit on top of parents(Like child of parents used to go top at first)  ) -->
<!-- Can chane position by changing position property -->
<!-- four types of positioning: Static, Relative, Absolute, fixed -->
<!-- Static is the default layout of htmls -->

<!-- Relative -->
<!-- By using positioning can change to relative which is before stativ by default.. and then can change the postion by using co- ordinates -->
<!-- can change margin to move since it's not relative means won't overlap. it will move from the before div or elemtent. But this will overlap and move depends on screen margin -->
<!-- Relative positioning doesn't affect anyother element on the screen -->

<!-- Absolute positioning -->
<!-- The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block(body). -->

<!-- Position an element based on its closest positioned ancestor position.Positioning depends on parents -->
<!-- Relative positioning adding margin to the element(h1,img) but absolute means adding margin to parent(body) h1 inside div(div is parent) -->
<!-- It will chagne exactly as we want like right means right left means left not like relative -->
<!-- It will affect the layout -->
<!-- https://leannezhang.medium.com/difference-between-css-position-absolute-versus-relative-35f064384c6#:~:text=position%3A%20relative%20places%20an%20element,changing%20the%20layout%20around%20it. use this link for better understanding -->
<!-- Fixed -->
<!-- Will stick to the screen while we scroll also -->
<!-- if u want something like profile or like that stick to the screen -->

<!-- Centering elements -->
<!-- can center elemtents with using text align center but it works only if the element is inlinr block or block element with no altered width.if its alter have to use margin method -->
<!-- Using auto in margin used to center elements -->
<!-- margin top right bottom left = putting top and bottom as zero and right and left as auto makes it center even if the width has been altered-->
<!-- even smaller margin o auto -> makes o to top and bottom and auto to left and right -->

<!-- Font styling -->
<!-- Font family- will mostly use serf and sand serf, monospace is used for coding since its havinf same width for every tex. cursive, fantasy wont use much -->
<!-- sand serf has default arial font that can be changed -->
<!-- can't be sure every operating system has the font type we provided -->
<!-- can use font typers before sand serf multiple will work  one by one based on existence of that type in op system  -->
<!-- can download google fonts so that can deafultky download that font to make use everyone seeing outr font; called font embedding -->
<!-- can copy css link in html and add fonts in style sheet
 -->
 <!-- CSS font sizing -->
 <!-- Using pixels in font size may chagne the size . but it's not dynamic -->
 <!-- If user change preference to medium or less it may not change -->
 <!-- There are two ways to make it dynamic one is em and percentage -->
 <!-- but this  two will change based on root like  is our body is alreay 50px and u change h1 further it will go extra large based on body -->
 <!-- So it always better to use rem size so  it maynot change based on the root will adapt based on medium large size change -->
 <!-- 100%= 1em = 1rem = 16px -->

 <!-- Float property used to alling side by side of tow elements in div or any other. by example it will be clear -->
 <!-- clear is compplete opposite  to float so that we can undo flaot property specifically -->
